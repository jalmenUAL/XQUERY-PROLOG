# XQUERY-PROLOG
PROLOG IMPLEMENTATION OF XQUERY

An implementation of the XQuery language using logic programming (in particular, by means of Prolog). Such implementation has been developed using the Prolog interpreter SWI-Prolog. Firstly, a XML document can be loaded by means of the XML library of SWI-Prolog. Secondly, a query expressed in XQuery against the given XML document can be encoded by means of rules. Such Prolog rules are executed in order to obtain the answer (which is also a XML document) of the query.
